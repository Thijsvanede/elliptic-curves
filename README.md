# elliptic-curves
Implementation of Elliptic Curves - used for crypto CTFs.

This is a disclaimer that I shouldn't have to make, but please don't use this implementation for actual cryptographic products.
It is simply an implementation for me (and others interested in Elliptic Curve crypto) to toy with.
